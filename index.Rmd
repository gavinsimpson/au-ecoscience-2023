Many of us will be familiar with trends like this

Global biodiversity is in trouble

Wherever we look we see declining populations

Living Plant Index is an average measure of change (so some time series in a region could be increasing even if overall we have a decline in LPI)

Splines are built up from basis functions

Here I'm showing a cubic regression spline basis with 10 knots/functions

We weight each basis function to get a spline. Here all the basis functions have the same weight so they would fit a horizontal line

Fitting a GAM involves finding the weights for the basis functions that produce a spline that fits the data best, subject to some constraints

---

# GAM summary

1. GAMs give us a framework to model flexible nonlinear relationships

2. Use little functions (**basis functions**) to make big functions (**smooths**)

3. Use a **penalty** to trade off wiggliness/generality 

4. Need to make sure your smooths are **wiggly enough**

# Grassland arthropod abundance

Our example:

* Abundance of all identified Arthropods

* Grassland sites only

* Models

    * Linear global and site-specific trends (random slopes & intercepts)
    * Smooth trend of `year` plus `site` random intercepts
    * Regional smooths of `year` plus `site` random intercepts
    * Regional smooths of `year`, `site` specific *random* smooths
    * Regional smooths of `year`, year-to-year effects, `site` specific *random* smooths

# Random smooths?

* Random intercepts
* Random slopes
* Random smooths?

Random smooths yield a separate smooth for each subject

Share a wiggliness penalty (plus $\lambda$ for intercepts & slopes)

But individual trends can have different shape

* Equivalent mixed linear trend model (with Y2Y effects): AIC 15468 (111.8 EDF)

Use year-to-year effects or not?

(For these data) **A** and **B** are different ways to decompose the temporal effects

* Without Y2Y &#8594;	wigglier regional smooths
* With Y2Y &#8594; less wiggly regional smooths

Even with relatively simple data, GAMs yield much better fit than linear equiv.

# Summary

How we model trends in biodiversity data can change our view of losses and gains

Using "smooth" trends gives much better fit for the arthropod data here

Y2Y effects and / or smooth trends represent different decompositions of the *temporal* effect

Non/linear methods needed if we want to assess changes in rates of change

Figure caption from Gilbert (2021)

Schematic diagram showing how climate change can affect ticks directly (by changing oviposition, development, mortality rates, and activity) and indirectly (by changing habitat and host species and abundance). Climate change can, in turn, affect tick-borne pathogen infection risk in humans by directly affecting human behavior (e.g., outdoor recreation) and indirectly affecting pathogen transmission rates and prevalence via hosts and ticks. The relative importance of each pathway is challenging to ascertain.

Easy &mdash; using data in previous figure, find week in each year where $\widehat{\texttt{cases}}_j$ is maximal

--

Harder &mdash; account for the uncertainty in the model & put an uncertainty band on $\widehat{\texttt{peak}}_j$

# Representing trends

With the penalty idea we can imagine several ways to account for temporal effects in GAMs

1. Fixed year effects
2. Random year effects
3. MRF equivalent of AR
4. Smooth
5. Linear
6. ...
